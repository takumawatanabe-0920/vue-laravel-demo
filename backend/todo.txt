Learning Points in Laravel: Advanced query building with Eloquent ORM, view composers.
By adding these features, you'll not only enhance the functionality of the task management app but also dive deep into various aspects of the Laravel framework, such as database operations, integration with the frontend, and implementing an authentication system, thereby gaining a comprehensive knowledge base for web application development.


Urgent Task
Behavior: An urgent task is set with a higher priority over other tasks and sends immediate notifications to prompt the user's attention. Furthermore, upon creation, an urgent task should be displayed at the top of the task list.
Method Examples:
sendImmediateNotification(): Notifies the user about the presence of an urgent task immediately.
highlightTask(): Processes to make this task stand out in the task list.
Recurring Task
Behavior: A recurring task needs to be repeated at regular intervals, allowing the user to set the frequency of the task (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). Each time it is completed, it automatically reschedules itself for the next scheduled time.
Method Examples:
setFrequency(frequency): Sets the repetition frequency of the task.
rescheduleNextOccurrence(): Reschedules the task for its next scheduled occurrence.
Deadline Task
Behavior: A deadline task is set with a specific deadline and sends reminders to the user as the deadline approaches. Once the deadline has expired, the user receives a notification of the deadline expiry.
Method Examples:
setDeadline(deadline): Sets the deadline for the task.
sendReminderNotification(): Notifies the user as the deadline approaches.
notifyDeadlineExpired(): Notifies the user that the task's deadline has expired.
